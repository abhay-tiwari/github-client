## **Upgrade Steps**

### 1. **Upgrade Dependencies**

I upgraded the NPM packages to their latest versions. To do that, I updated packages in `package.json` file then use 

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. **Breaking Changes**

There were some important changes that might break parts of the project. Iâ€™ve outlined them below, and I made sure to adjust the code accordingly.

#### **Example Breaking Changes:**
- **Material-UI**: The `@material-ui/core` package has been replaced with `@mui/material` in version `v6`. Some components and their props might have changed.
  - I updated imports throughout the project to use `@mui/material` instead of `@material-ui/core`.
  
  Example:
  ```js
  // Old Import (Material-UI v4)
  import { Button } from '@material-ui/core';

  // New Import (Material-UI v6)
  import { Button } from '@mui/material';
  ```

- **React Router v6**: With the upgrade to React Router v6, routes and navigation handling have changed. I made sure to update any routing logic.

  Example:
  ```js
  // Old Router (React Router v5)
  <Route path="/about" component={Repositories} />

  // New Router (React Router v6)
  <Route path="/about" element={<Repositories />} />
  ```

### 3. **Configuration Updates**

- **Vite**: Since I have moved from webpack to Vite as a build tool, I added `vite.config.ts` and removed `webpack.config.js` file.

- **Environment Variables**: Added `VITE_` in env variables.
